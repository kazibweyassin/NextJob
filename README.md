Branches

We use two branches for development and deployment:

    Main Branch (main): This is the primary development branch where all features and changes are merged. It contains the full application code.

    GitHub Pages Branch (gh-pages): This branch is specifically used for deployment. It contains the production-ready build of the application hosted via GitHub Pages.

You can switch between branches using:

bash

git checkout main
git checkout gh-pages

Switching to the gh-pages Branch:

Use this branch to view the deployment code. Note that gh-pages contains the optimized static build for deployment, while main has the source code for development.
